            Superhero movies have become serious fare nowadays. There's usually world-ending stakes mixed with serious dramatics. In the midst of all that brooding gravitas, here comes Shazam which takes it all the way back to the core of it all; child-like wonder and pure wish-fulfillment of what it would be like for a kid to be a superhero.

                <p>"Coming of age" is a term that gets tossed around a lot. But in Shazam's case, it's literally a core part of the film. There's the literal age-up of it's main character Billy Batson, who goes from being fourteen to a full-blown muscle-man complete with flight, super-strength, speed and lighting bolts. And there's also the underlying story of finding family and home, which didn't get sacrificed in the midst of all the theatrics. By the end, it'll really endear you to the family at the heart of this film, which is in no small part, thanks to the wonderful cast. Billy and Freddy might be the starring characters, but keep an eye out for Darla; she really steals the show.</p>

        <p>Shazam is hilariously funny in all the right moments. The humour isn't childish; it's clever and witty, and there are so many jokes and funny references flying around that you might need a couple of viewings to appreciate them all. The way it integrates the superhero mythos into its environment without being too heavy-handed on connectivity is just right. It's quite fun to spot all the easter-eggs and references to other superheroes.</p>
        <p><i>Just on a personal note, any fans of The OC, will have a fantastic pay-off when they spot Adam Brody in the movie. Now that was pure wish-fulfillment for the kid in me!</i>

It's well-crafted, with a talented and charming cast, filled to the brim with action, story, heart and laughs a plenty. There are so many wonderful surprises throughout, and it sets up a really interesting future for the franchise. The thing is, Shazam makes being a superhero fun again!</p>

                   Marvel has built itself a reputation for better or worse. Watching one of the MCU films elicits certain expectations from the audience, and Captain Marvel is no different. Having said that, Captain Marvel was perfectly adequate as a film. It had a handful of interesting moments, sprinklings of the Marvel-brand of humour that is synonymous with these movies, and the typical high octane action scenes that are to be expected. 
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-7">
                <p>The effects are well executed, the actors do their best, and the story takes on a neat blend of the amnesiac-self-discovery and the fish-out-of-water plot. There are a couple of twists in the movie that, while not particularly mind-blowing, are well-executed. And there are a few hilarious moments of 90s nostalgia that made everyone chuckle. Carol Danvers is unapologetic in her strength and ability, and it's another flavour of a female hero, that is a welcome addition to the fold.
                </p>
                <p>Nothing really falls flat in the film. Everything feels polished and finely-tuned, from the dialogue to the set design to the characterizations. <b>And therein lies the flaw; the movie felt a little too cookie-cutter.</b></p>

            <p>There wasn't a moment I could point to as truly epic and memorable, or a character that I felt emotionally invested in. Nor did I feel anxious or tense at any point in the movie. I felt safe throughout, because the movie is safe, through and through. By the time we reach the third-act, the movie felt so completely devoid of tension, that I found myself feeling slightly bored by the action scenes, waiting instead for the quieter scenes that would follow to wrap up the story. </p>

                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">Captain Marvel is definitely an entertaining and well-executed movie. And for hard-core Marvel fans, it's a must watch, simply for it's interconnectivity with the Avengers film to follow. Marvel really tries its best to push Carol Danvers as an integral and valuable character to the MCU, and at times it might feel a little forced, but I can't fault them for trying. The film is not a misstep by any means, and there is potential for a truly spectacular sequel in the future. The thing is, Captain Marvel is a glowing example of a movie that is just perfectly fine; nothing more, nothing less.</p>

                <p>
                   In an era of event movies that mostly consist of big franchises and tons of special effects, there's still magic to be found in the artistry of music and its power to connect people. It's not very often that a movie-going experience can cross genre barriers and transcend generations. But with the not-so-secret weapon of Queen's iconic music in its back pocket, Bohemian Rhapsody has a near fool-proof means of entertaining a wide range of movie-goers. And entertain, it does.
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>As bio-pics go, the movie somewhat falls short, as it jumps sporadically between various eras in the life of Freddie Mercury and the journey of the band named Queen. It doesn't delve too far into the complexities of his relationships, whether with his family or his loved ones, though every significant relationship is given some screen time. The movie moves at a blistering pace, and there's just no time to dwell on anything more than a few snatches of dialogue and some blink-and-you'll-miss-it montages. In fact, out of all the relationships portrayed, the one that comes out the truest and purest of all is the familial bond between the members of the band.

    <section class="" id="sec3">
        <div class="container">
            <p>In my opinion, however, Bohemian Rhapsody isn't meant as a true biopic, but rather as a musical journey. Its best moments are those that capture the inspiration, experimentation and genius of the band. The film reaches for the stars whenever the band is performing, and you feel the rush and raw energy of Queen's music, culminating in an electrifying final performance piece.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>	The movie is well-acted overall, with a more than capable cast, and the music believably performed. Rami Malek especially delivers an incredible performance, disappearing completely into the role of Freddie Mercury, mimicking his every nuance and gesture on stage and off. There are a few moments of comedy, heart-felt drama and emotion that help to bolster the film as a whole, though nothing that stands out as anything we haven't seen on film before.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="" id="sec4">
        <div class="container">
            <p>If you're looking for a poignant examination of the Aids crisis, or a deep exposé of the darker periods of Freddie Mercury's personal life and the demons he may have struggled with, look elsewhere. Bohemian Rhapsody stands out more as a showcase of artistry and passion. It's a moving film, not because of the personal drama and tragedy that shrouded Freddie's life, although those events do land somewhat of a dramatic punch. But you'll be far more emotionally moved when the band is on stage doing what they do best, and for a moment you feel an ounce of the energy that must have prevailed over a Queen concert. </p>
        </div>

    <section id="summary">
        <div class="overlay"></div>

                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">So I would encourage you to see this movie in theatres, and feel the thud of the drums vibrating your seat, the thunder of the bass in tune with your pulse, the symphonic shred of Brian May's guitar in your ears and that singular voice of Freddie Mercury soaring over it all. That's the true magic of the film, and judging by how he wanted to be remembered, it seems a fitting tribute to one of music's most iconic lead-singers.</p>
                    <p><b>Pro tip:</b> I'm not one for promoting specific theatre chains, but if ever there was a movie to be enjoyed in Dolby Atmos Sound, this would be it ;)</p>

                <p>
                   By now, as sad as it is to say, I try not to expect too much from Jurassic Park movies. A franchise that was birthed by a masterclass of film-making, has for the most part, dwindled into popcorn fare with mega visuals and light thrills. Say what you will about the overall quality of Lost World and Jurassic Park 3, they still didn't feel like empty blockbusters. They presented some sort of serious story thread and character development, and at the very least, the dinosaurs were always scary and thrilling to watch. Sadly, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, has stripped this franchise of whatever fun it had left.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few reasons why Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom fails:
                </p>
            </div>
                
        </section>

    <section class="" id="sec3">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Characters are flatter than a pancake</h2>
            
            <p>	Remember that time when we actually had realistic multi-dimensional characters who actually have a story arc in Jurassic Park movies? They've successfully been driven into extinction in this movie. Sure, Chris Pratt is charming as always, but Bryce Dallas Howard is really the only character given at least an inch of space to develop. The supporting characters are tired stereotypes and one-sided at best. </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="" id="sec2"> 
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The dinosaurs just aren't scary anymore</h2>
        <div class="row">    
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="assets/img/jurassic/raptor.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>	The T-Rex and The Raptors from the older movies were always creatures that inspired fear. We could appreciate them as finely tuned predators, but they could just as easily haunt our nightmares. Jurassic World did away with this, by creating a new villainous dinosaur, and making the old ones heroes. Fallen Kingdom tries to continue this trend, but this time around, the new predator doesn't inspire awe or fear. I scare really easily, but even I sailed through this movie without feeling a twinge of fear. Actually, by the end of the film, I was actually rooting for the supposed "big bad" dinosaur.</p>

<section class="" id="sec4">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The villains are cartoons</h2>
            <p>	The villain characters might as well twirl their moustaches and wear name-badges that identify them as bad-guys. They have no dimension, no complexity, and beyond that, their plans are laughably bad. I'm talking Loony Tunes Willey Cayote bad.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

<section class="" id="sec5">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Plot holes and shallow call-backs</h2>
            
                     <p>	The movie is really a series of accidents and lucky-breaks, that are never consistent with what the story has set up as fact. Here's a dinosaur who's built to be an expert hunter with heightened senses to track prey in complex environments. But it can't locate 3 people crouched behind a pillar a couple of feet away. Here's a dinosaur that's brutishly strong and rips through wood and glass easily, but when confronted with a closed window, it doesn't just bust through, but gingerly turns the handle to open it. Simply because we must, must, must have a call-back to that iconic raptor scene in the first movie. A scene, which I must add, made more sense, since the raptor was opening a thick steel door that it couldn't break through. </p>
                
                
            
           
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="" id="sec6">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>There's nothing to worry about anymore</h2>
            <div class="row">    
                
                <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The villains hugely outnumber the heroes in this movie. So more often than not, we have scores of people in the vicinity of a dangerous dinosaur, but every single one of them is a bad-guy. Having a villainous dinosaur up against villainous humans, sucks out every ounce of tension in the scene. This movie actually succeeded in making dinosaur attacks boring.</p>

                   The battle has been fought; the dust has settled; and there is a clear winner. As much as I love DC, and as much as I wanted to love Justice League, having seen what Avengers: Infinity War accomplished, I have to admit; Marvel knows what it's doing. There's no denying they've had the hype-train to back them up nearly every time, but in this case, Infinity War is every bit worthy of the hype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's why I think Infinity War comes out as superior:

                    <p>Almost every member of the Avengers (yes, bafflingly Black Widow still doesn’t have a solo film), got their own stand-alone film, giving us their own personal story arc. This allowed each of them to come together in Infinity War, without any need for exposition or explanation. We knew these characters already, and we were ready to jump straight into the action with them.</p>

                    <p>Justice League introduced us to new characters right off the bat, with no back stories. This can work for a couple of characters at most, but when almost the entire team is based on this formula, there's no real investment from the audience. It's difficult to care about a character, when we don't really know them yet. And with having to juggle multiple newbies in one film, JL never really gave us a chance to care. We were spectators watching on the side-lines as it all unfolded, versus fans rooting for our favourite heroes.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of a decade, the MCU expertly teased and foreshadowed it's future characters and villains, with name-drops, hints and elaborately planned post-credit scenes. It all snow-balled into the perfect build up, that left fans guessing and speculating as to what each tease could mean, and Infinity War was the ultimate reward.</p>

                    <p>The Justice League team members were introduced via short video clips, clearly showing each character with their abilities on display. There was absolutely nothing left to the imagination, and it all happened just a couple of movies before their own titular film. The villain got a bit of less obvious foreshadowing, thanks to some well-placed "ding ding dings" from an imprisoned Lex Luthor, and an incoherent warning from a future Flash.</p>

                    <p>There's an obvious master plan at work within the MCU, and their confidence in the plan is evident in their unwillingness to be too flashy with it. The setting up of the Infinity Stones as objects of interest in Infinity War, was carefully played out over multiple movies. But the stones themselves were hardly ever the focus. More often than not, they were hiding in plain sight, and the audience were more invested in the story surrounding the hero, than the stones themselves. When we finally reached Infinity War, suddenly we all felt the true weight and importance of these immensely powerful objects. Even the scattering of the stones across multiple locations in the galaxy was a genius move, allowing for a neat scavenger hunt type story, and gave the film an excuse to break up the huge MCU roster into little mix-and-match teams that we could digest easily.</p>

                    <p>	As for Justice League; well, here's some ancient artefact that no one has ever mentioned before. It's important, trust us, it really is. Also, the bad guys are after it, so it needs to be protected. And... go!</p>

                    <p>Here's an area where the MCU has previously faltered in. The complaint has always been that the characters never really feel like they're in danger. Infinity War course corrected this in a huge way. Watching the film, it was apparent from the get-go that no one was safe. One wrong move could literally mean the end of life as we know it. And with every mistake and setback, we  as an audience felt the tension and weight of impending doom. Infinity War set up some massive stakes, and then committed whole-heartedly to them. </p>

                    <p>The threat in Justice League felt isolated and impersonal. DC changed it up from their previous films, which never shied away from showing realistic casualties of battle, and instead bowed to their critics, hoping to win them over. What resulted was a tepid movie, where there was never a doubt that pretty much everyone was going to make it out of this alive and well.</p>

                    <p>There's no denying that Infinity War was Thanos' movie. This was another course correction for the MCU, which, in the past, had suffered from a slew of forgettable villains, not counting Loki of course. But Thanos delivered just the right amount of backstory to let us see some depth to his actions, but maintained enough mystery that we were never really ever sure what his next move would be. Also, he felt like a real person, with emotions, complex motivations, and convictions. It's easy enough to watch the film from Thanos' perspective and see him as the hero of his own story.</p>

                    <p>Steppenwolf, the villain of Justice League, was aloof and melodramatic. He felt like the typical throw-away baddie, who's only real purpose was to give our heroes something to cobble. </p>

                    <p>MCU movies for the most part, have never really garnered much praise for stunning visuals or ambitious cinematography, and that's because they've always kept their visual effects streamlined to depict our real-world as much as possible. They always felt grounded and dare I say, even a little boring visually. But that philosophy paid off in spades for Infinity War. When your story takes place across multiple planets, and mythical locations, it can be hard to keep the audience feeling like their still watching something real. The grounded-ness of the visual effects really helped to balance things out, so that the surroundings never felt like a distraction.</p>

                    <p>Zach Snyder's heavy use of green screen environments, which we know, can be supremely beautiful on-screen, really tipped towards video game territory come the final act of Justice League. It became harder and harder to suspend disbelief, with the obvious CGI background surrounding the action. What started off as artistic, ultimately ended as a distraction.</p>

                   In a movie that was chock-full of amazing visuals, engaging story and incredible action, it's hard to narrow down just a handful of moments to tout as the best. And yet here we are, doing the impossible. Will wonders never cease? </p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	Let me start off with the most obvious one. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't absolutely love the No-man's Land sequence, and with good reason. It's an incredibly powerful moment in the film, where Diana, finally fed-up with being told that she cannot help, literally steps up to embrace her role as an active participant, rather than a passive bystander.</p>
                                    <p>Everything, from the way it's set-up, the angles it's shot with, down to the pounding score behind it, elevates this scene to one of the most epic superhero moments on film. The gravity of seeing a female superhero showcased in such mythic proportions for the first time, was emotionally powerful. This moment screams importance.</p>

                                  <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	This is a cheat moment, because it really encompasses two moments in the film. The first is on the beaches of Themyscira as the Amazons war with the German soldiers. There's an unforgettable moment where Antiope, the general of the Amazon Army, shouts "Shield!", and the Amazon nearby knows exactly what to do, using her shield to propel Antiope high above the battlefield and take down three Germans with one shot. It's a testament to the Amazons' training and skill at working together, not to mention it's just an outright bad-ass moment.</p>
                                 
                                 <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">	There's an extremely satisfying call-back to this moment much later in the film, when Steve, having witnessed this move on Themyscira, mirrors it to help Diana take out a sniper in the tower of the German encampment. Not only is the move executed perfectly, it results in Diana literally annihilating the tower; the perfect finale to the extended battle that liberates the village from hostile control.</p>

                                It's rare for a summer blockbuster superhero movie to spend much time building their characters quite as deliberately as Wonder Woman does. One of those exceptional quieter character moments happens after the battle at Veld, with the villagers celebrating their freedom into the night. What starts as casual banter about dancing, turns into a wonderful intimate discussion between Diana and Steve, as they dance under a light snow-fall.

                                The setting itself is beautifully romantic, but the conversation itself is what elevates the moment. The discussion of the mundane beauty of life outside of wartime,  serves as a point on the futility of war in itself, but perhaps more importantly, subtly hints at a common desire between both characters to explore the possibilities of their relationship once the war is over.

                            It's the final nail in the coffin of Diana's naivety regarding the world of mankind. It's her final realization that humans are not simply pure beacons of goodness, but can be agents of corruption and darkness all on their own. After killing General Ludendorff, and witnessing the activities of war continuing around her, Diana is confused and reaches a state of panic, as she realizes that all that she once believed in is put into question. Steve's speech to her about the harsh reality of mankind is poignant at this time. He needs her help to stop the war, but he doesn't sugar-coat reality. He tells Diana the truth. There isn't one bad guy to blame. We're all to blame. And even as Diana whispers "I'm not", Steve's reply is even more telling of his character; "but maybe I am". </p>
                        <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.5s">
                            Steve accepts that even he probably doesn't deserve Diana's help, and that mankind is inherently flawed, and he along with the rest. If help were dealt to merely those that deserve it, then perhaps none would really deserve help. But believing in doing the right thing to change a world full of wrongs, is more important, and it's the philosophy that stays with Diana and shapes her morality long after the war is over.

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">This statement is made almost off-hand by Hippolyta at the start of the film when she tries to convince a young Diana that war is nothing to hope for. It's a strange statement to be made in a movie that is at least partially a war-film. However, it is the final driving message of the film, that Diana herself realizes by the end. War merely breeds more war, and sometimes the greatest acts of heroism have nothing to do with fighting. This is exemplified in the heart-breaking moment when Steve courageously sacrifices himself. It's this act that spurs Diana to embrace a more optimistic outlook on mankind as a whole. </p>
                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">The double playback of his farewell to her is used powerfully to remind Diana, that not all men are selfish war-mongers. Steve isn't sacrificing himself for her, he already knows she's immune to the poisonous gas. So rather than it be some sort of epic gesture of romantic love, instead it's an act of pure selflessness for what he believes is right, giving up any future he might have had with her, in order to save thousands of nameless and faceless people. And it's this moment, when played for the second time, with the realization of what Steve had really done, that causes Diana to set aside her wrath, and show mercy to Doctor Maru, and declare that she believes in something far greater than war and judgement. </p>

And it allows her to shine as a beacon of hope and love, and truly be the superhero we all really need.</p>

                    As I sat in the theatre with the lights dimmed and the all new DC logo forming on the screen in front of me, the sense of sheer anticipation I was feeling is hard to describe in words. Somehow, this movie meant something more than just a movie to me. Somehow, I found myself personally invested in this, and wanting more than anything to see a movie that could live up to all my hype and aspirations for it. </p>
                <p>And it did.</p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">Wonder Woman is not just a good superhero movie; it's a great movie, period. In fact, it doesn't really feel like a superhero movie at all. It starts off as a telling of ancient mythology and fantasy, and leads into what can only be described as a war film. And war seems to be the word heard most throughout the film, and yet at every turn, we the audience know that war is not the hero of this movie. Peace, Justice and Love are the final victors of the day, and the message is carried upon the shoulders of what is clearly the best superhero to come out of the DC Extended Universe yet.</p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">I could go on and on about the cinematography, the nuanced performances, the thrilling action and the overall cohesiveness of the story as a whole. These are all executed brilliantly in the movie, no doubt. And even if all you're looking for is an entertaining and engaging film, or even just a ton of eye-candy, you'll enjoy Wonder Woman.</p>

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">But as a woman, watching a powerful female heroine conquering the battlefield, leading the charge, and standing for what's right; it was exhilarating. I never realized how much I wanted to feel represented in the films I watch, until I saw it done right. And Wonder Woman does it right.</p>

She <i>is</i> Wonder Woman. Sweetly innocent, extremely powerful and carrying herself with elegance and grace, Gal is nothing short of inspiring to watch. Chris Pine delivers my favourite performance of his to date, and his undeniable chemistry with Gal lays the foundation for some of the most moving moments of the film.

                                Patty Jenkins has achieved something monumental with this movie. Being the first female director to be at the helm of a film of this scale, she has undoubtedly succeeded in crafting a great piece of film-making. This will be a historic mark for female directors, and will hopefully open up more opportunities for us to see a female voice represented not just in small indie films, but also in big summer blockbusters.

                            The movie blends together a myriad of genres and tones, starting us off in realms of greek mythology on the island of Themyscira, and transitioning to the complete opposite side of the spectrum, in the harsh filth of world war one. It's a vivid contrast in atmosphere, but the movie handles it well. It perfectly combines epic action, with poignant emotional moments, dashes of sincere humor that doesn't feel forced, and compelling character growth. I was half-expecting them to avoid romance in the movie, merely as a way to subvert any clichés of the genre, but even that aspect is handled tastefully and feels completely believable and honest in the context of the story.</p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">A note on the humour; superhero movies as of late seem to be trying their hardest to make us laugh. And if you've been paying attention, you'd have noticed that it's starting to beat the audience over the head with it. DC as a whole seems to have avoided that approach with DCEU, but when Wonder Woman was touted as being lighter and more humourous movie, I had trepidations that it would have been too "marvel-ized". But as a credit to the screenwriters, the movie's laughs feel completely natural in the narrative, and the comedy weaves itself seamlessly into the story.

                        <p>
                            As the credits rolled, and the closing soundtrack soared, I had to sit in my seat for awhile before I was ready to leave the theatre. I felt moved, hopeful and optimistic. I felt inspired and uplifted. I wanted to immediately watch the film all over again. And funnily enough, at that moment, I wished I had a daughter whom I could show this film to, and tell her that superheroes can look like her. I truly think this movie will have a lasting resonance and impact in years to come, and while it is a great film, it's also an important film for a generation of movie-goers. The thing is, Wonder Woman is what we've been waiting for and so much more.

                    With every glimpse into the upcoming Wonder Woman movie, there's a collective thrum of anticipation for what's to come. Could this finally be a female superhero movie that could supersede that classification? Could it just be a great superhero movie, or better yet, could it just be a great movie? I think it will be. </p>

                <h2 class="subheading text-center" data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">And here's why:</h2>
                <div class="container">

                            <h3 data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">Timely and Timeless Character Design</h3>
                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.4s">Zack Snyder's unique vision for the DCEU has included incredible character designs for our favourite heroes. He's succeeded in making them stand above the world around them, Gods among men, and Wonder Woman more so than others.</p>
                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.5s">Her first-ever character poster was met with some scepticism due to the dull tones and monochromatic color-correction. But once we saw it in action in Batman v Superman, all doubts were tabled. Even though her armour was a lot more muted in comparison to the comics, it made sense for the narrative context in terms of it being centuries old. When the posters for the Wonder Woman movie were released, we got an even better look at that iconic costume in it's true glory. </p>
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-sm-6">

                                    <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s">They embraced the vibrant hues, and showed off the deep reds and blues that harken back to her original comic look, without being gaudy or overdone. The overall design of her costume is based around greek armour, and expertly walks that fine-line between femininity and ferocity. And while it is a substantially revealing outfit as a whole, somehow she doesn't look overly-sexualized as she has often been in the comics.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.2s"> Giving us a version of Wonder Woman that stays true to her comic roots, while updating her for our time, and still keeps her looking timeless, is a feat to be applauded. Wonder Woman's character design could have easily veered into gratuitous or silly territory, but it ends up being undoubtedly powerful and undoubtedly beautiful.

                            <p>When Gal Gadot was cast as the world's most famous female superhero, the internet had a collective meltdown. One criticism was due to her being too much of a new-comer to carry such a weighty role. But annoyingly, the loudest criticism was around her physical appearance. Fans argued that she wasn't, as she so sweetly put it, "big-hearted" enough for the role of Wonder Woman, who was generally portrayed as a buxom female with her costume barely managing to contain her curves. Those arguments have all since been quelled, after Gal managed to steal the show from two of the greatest superheroes in history in their own movie no less, even with very little screen-time.</p>

                            <p>Her embodiment of the character both on and off screen has been apparent. She exudes charisma and sophistication, and yet she's not afraid to be goofy and there's just something so entirely relatable about her. More than anything, she's proved that regardless of your physicality or others' expectations of you, how you carry yourself as an individual will be what matters in the end. She's brought a whole new dimension to a 75 year-old character, and for that, Gal, we salute you!</p>

                                Having a female director be at the helm of the first live-action Wonder Woman movie is an important place to start. To have a director with the talent and gravitas that Patty Jenkins brings to the table, is an even bigger asset to the movie. Not only is she an award-winning film-maker, but hearing her talk about the project with such affection and warmth, makes it evident that she is as ardent a fan as any. A perfect blend of talent and passion is exactly what this movie needs to go beyond being good, and be great.

                            The movie's taglines reveal the over-arcing themes of this character; someone who is undeniably powerful, and  someone who cares deeply about making a difference that matters. Wonder Woman brings a unique perspective of Justice and Wisdom that juxtaposes mankind's incessant obsession with needless violence. She vows to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. She may not be the hero we deserve, but she's the hero we need. </p>

                            <p data-scroll-reveal="enter from the bottom after 0.3s">Chris Pine plays the role of Steve Trevor, Wonder Woman's love interest in the film. Just for starters, having him in the film at all is a big plus, since he's super talented and irresistibly likeable in all of his movies. Add on to that the chemistry between him and Gal, along with his witty quips, and Chris will no doubt be the comic highlight of the movie. Throw in names like Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Lucy Davis and Connie Nielson, and it's plain to see that Wonder Woman has a cast that's oozing with talent.</p>

                                        As promotional material has revealed thus far, the movie will visit various settings, from the breath-taking paradise isle of Thymescira, to the muddy trenches of World War 1. It introduces Diana to a world where women weren't particularly deemed on par with men in their society. Her unique worldview contrasting with the ideas of that era, will certainly prove to be comical as well as thought-provoking. And beyond that, this movie just looks amazing.

            <span>My number 1 most anticipated movie of the year. Gal Gadot headlines the first standalone female superhero movie of the current era. The weight of the future of the DCEU rests on her shoulders, but I believe Wonder Woman will achieve the greatness she deserves. </span>

                    Rogue One is exactly what its subtitle suggests; a story based in the Star Wars universe. It sits between Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) and Episode IV (A New Hope). In fact, it literally tells the story of the first couple of lines in the Opening Crawl of Episode IV.</p>

                <p>In summary, Rogue One is the tale of rag-tag members of a fledgling Rebel Alliance coming together to steal the plans to the Galactic Empire's superweapon, The Deathstar. It acts as the launching pad for the events that lead to the final take-down of Empire, and fleshes out the entire Star Wars universe in a very satisfying way. Indeed it's a brilliant achievement on the part of this film, that it takes one line of exposition, and turns it into a well-rounded and entertaining story.</p>

                            While the movie centers on the rebels, the primary focus rests on Jyn Erso, played by a quietly strong Felicity Jones, a young woman who is haunted by her family's connection to the Empire. She is supported by strong performances from Diego Luna as Captain Cassian Andor, Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Donnie Yen as Chirrut Imwe and Ben Mendelsohn as the deliciously villainous Orson Krennic. There are many other famous faces and engaging performances scattered throughout the film, and as a whole the cast gels well together to bring us, what is easily, the most diverse Star Wars movie we have ever seen.

                 <p>There are electric moments of chemistry between the cast members, be it a deep rooted friendship between Chirrut and Baze, or the palpable sexual tension between Jyn and Cassian. It's been awhile since I saw a movie where the male and female lead don’t share a single on-screen kiss, and yet have as much chemistry as Felicity Jones and Diego Luna.</p>

                 <p>A special mention of the droid K-2SO, voiced and performed by Alan Tudyk. He easily became an instant stand-out in the movie, stealing the scene whenever he was on screen. His witty and sarcastic remarks, delivered in Tudyk's dead-pan matter-of-fact tone of voice, had the theatre audience laughing out loud.

                            The action is well choreographed, and feels dangerous. In an age where nearly every action movie borrows from the school of Jason Bourne's quick-cut mayhem, it's wonderful to see the action through steady, long-held camera shots. It allows us to truly appreciate each moment of choreography. Donnie Yen especially lends a sense of believability to his action scenes, as he obviously knows what he's doing. The movie as a whole divides its action into two halves, where the first hour of the film has more close-quartered action, while the final hour moves to a grander scale with epic space battles. Both are handled exceptionally well.</p>

                           One issue I had: The notion of debilitating a Storm Trooper using hand to hand combat seemed a little too convenient. <em>I mean, that is armour that they're wearing, right?</em></p>

                        <p>
                            The great thing about Rogue One is that you can go in as a complete Star Wars noob, and still have a fairly enjoyable movie-going experience, because it stands on its own as a well-constructed story. But if you're familiar with Star Wars lore, and if you've watched the previous movies, you're going to be positively gleeful. It has numerous appearances by familiar faces throughout the Star Wars anthology, and it perfectly bridges together the Prequels with the Original Trilogy. While Hollywood has been overrun with sequels/prequels/reboots that all try their best to play on our nostalgia, Rogue One has done it the best so far. Beyond merely referencing an existing franchise, it actually builds on it and improves it.</p>

                           If you've seen the trailer, then it should come as no surprise to you that Darth Vader makes an appearance in this movie. He's not in it extensively, but his presence is definitely felt in a powerful way. No spoilers, but there's a scene towards the end of the movie involving Lord Vader that was simply breath-taking. I've been a casual Star Wars fan for a long time, and I've watched every movie in the series, but I never really understood why Darth Vader was often considered the number 1 villain in movie history. I never really understood the menace or fear that the characters in the movies seemed to feel in his presence. That was until I saw Rogue One. Once you see the movie, you'll understand.

                            Rogue One is action-packed, engaging and thoroughly entertaining. Some viewers might find the first half of the movie a little slow-moving, but the pay-off at the end is well-worth it.  I'm going to say something a little controversial here; but understand that I didn't grow up with the original trilogy and I found the prequels somewhat lacking. Episode VII: The Force Awakens was a fun ride and I definitely enjoyed it. But the thing is Rogue One just might be my favourite Star Wars movie.
