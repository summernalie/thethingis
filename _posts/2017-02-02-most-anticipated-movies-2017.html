There's sure to be at least a couple that are on everyone's radar, but with such a vast array of movies coming up, it's easy to miss out on a few. So for easy reference, here are some of the upcoming movie releases in 2017 that ooze potential, and have our curiosities piqued. <br/>(Note: This is not a comprehensive list, just some of the ones that I'm personally anticipating.)</p>

                    Hover over each movie, to see why you should be excited and to view the trailers (if you're on a mobile device, tap on a movie). You can also filter the movies by genre or popularity, and sort by release date or my level of anticipation.

            <p class="level">01</p>
            <span>My number 1 most anticipated movie of the year. Gal Gadot headlines the first standalone female superhero movie of the current era. The weight of the future of the DCEU rests on her shoulders, but I believe Wonder Woman will achieve the greatness she deserves. </span>

            <span>Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Green Lantern… the list goes on. Probably the greatest collection of superheroes to ever be assembled in one movie, Justice League would really have to work a miracle to not be entertaining.

            <span>Supposedly Hugh Jackman's last outing as everyone's favourite mutant, Wolverine returns to the big-screen with a very different kind of superhero movie. The tone looks grim, and decidedly violent, but intermixed with drama and heavy emotional undertones. Also keep an eye out for the introduction of the next incarnation of Wolverine.

            <span>A harrowing look at the horrors of war through the lense of Christopher Nolan, director of the Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. If you're a fan of Saving Private Ryan, something tells me, you're going to be a fan of Dunkirk as well.

            <span>The Skywalker Chronicles continue! It doesn't take a lot of convincing to get on board with the latest episode of Star Wars, especially coming on the heels of the triumphant Rogue One. More Luke Skywalker, can only mean good things. It will also likely be the last time we see Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia, so it will certainly be an emotional day at the theatre.

            <p class="level">21</p>
            <span>A somewhat quirky-looking sci-fi adventure, with a ton of incredible visuals, I don't know much about Valerian, but I'm curious to learn more. Can Cara Delevingne finally prove once and for all that she's a legitimate actress, and help us all forget that awful dancey performance in Suicide Squad?</span>

            <p class="level">26</p>
            <span>Imagine discovering the world for the very first time as a teenager.

As he journeys to Earth for the first time, the film explores new encounters, falling in love, and discovering your place in the world. </span>

            <p class="level">12</p>
            <span>Repeating the same day over and over again is hardly a new premise for a movie. But Before I Fall isn't a flashy sci-fi action blockbuster. It's a quiet indie film, where one girl, while in the process of being doomed to repeat the same day again and again, must discover how even the smallest, most mundane moments can shape the course of the future, and to make every second count.</span>

            <span>King Kong is back! And he's bigger than ever! Kong Skull Island will take us back to the 80s where we'll be introduced to the biggest incarnation of King Kong that we've seen yet. Why is he so big? Because, if all goes well, he'll be battling Godzilla on the big screen in the not too distant future. Also, the movie stars Tom Hiddleston, so that should be enough of a draw.

            <span>Yet another reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this time with Marvel onboard. While we should all be sorely tired of seeing yet another new iteration of the character, Spiderman Homecoming managed to do the impossible; it actually got me excited for it, with a charming and entertaining trailer, that somehow breathed new life into the character.

            <span>Just when we'd all settled on Batman as the darkest, most serious superhero ever, here comes the Lego Batman Movie, to show us a completely different take on the Dark Knight. The trailers have been hilarious, poking fun at the stoic and dark nature of the character, with even a little jab at Batman v Superman. It looks to be a fun and entertaining movie going experience.

            <p class="level">10</p>
            <span>This brand new iteration of the Power Rangers seems to be oozing with cheese, but when you're talking about 5 teens who dress up in colourful super suits and fight monsters, it's pretty hard to avoid cheesiness. If you're willing to forgive the campiness, it just might be a fun call-back to your childhood. The special effects look cool enough.

            <p class="level">09</p>
            <span>The first Kingsman movie was a wildly entertaining action film. With tons of fun parodies of typical spy genre tropes, along with some truly spectacular action scenes, it was a standout movie. If this sequel can be even half as entertaining as its predecessor, then count me in. Manners maketh a man!

            <p class="level">22</p>
            <span>Forget the goofy action comedy of the last decade. This is a reboot of the franchise, with Tom Cruise along for the ride. Will it be Mission Impossible with Mummies? Perhaps. But how could that possibly be a bad thing. Also, this time we'll be dealing with a female version of the monster.

            <span>Charlie Hunnam stars as the titular character in this origin-story of sorts. It doesn't look like any Arthurian tale we've ever seen before, and considering that this is from Guy Richie, the director of the Sherlock Holmes films and last year's criminally underrated Man from UNCLE, King Arthur Legend of the Sword looks to a movie worth seeing.

            <p class="level">28</p>
            <span>The Belko Experiment is one of those movies that makes you question, "what would you do if you were in that situation?" It's a horrifying premise, being trapped with your co-workers and being told to choose who lives and dies. It's sure to raise questions of morality vs survival, and it has Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn at the helm.</span>

            <span>The Pirates franchise doesn't quite excite us like it used to, but there's hope for Dead Men Tell No Tales, as it sees the return of Orlando Bloom, and hopefully a return to a tighter storyline focusing on characters we care about.

            <p class="release">7 April 2017</p>
            <p class="level">14</p>
            <span>If Dunkirk is a little too intense for you, Their Finest examines World War 2 through a different perspective. A female screen-writer in a British film crew, must overcome stereotypes and discrimination to do her part to help in the war. Though set in a difficult period, the film presents a heart-warming and comedic story, with charming performances by Gemma Arterton, Sam Claflin and Bill Nighy.</span>

            <p class="release">14 July 2017</p>
            <p class="level">27</p>
            <span>If you like your period dramas with a darker flavour than typical Jane Austen-fare, then My Cousin Rachel looks to be right up your alley. Based on the popular Daphne Du Maurier novel, the film stars Sam Claflin and Rachel Weiz in a mysterious and twisted love affair. I haven't read the novel, but the trailer alone has me curious about this story.</span>

            <p class="level">23</p>
            <span>The Lost City of Z revolves around the real-life story of a British explorer on his search for a forgotten city in the depths of the amazon. The movie looks to blend adventure with the eeriness of the unknown, and stars Carlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson, who just happens to be sporting a glorious beard. Uncharted territory indeed.</span>
