                   If there was one word I could use to describe Justice League, it's "hope." The movie's plot centers around this, with the direction of the film itself continuously driving home the theme of hope, future and promise. Hope even clings to each of the core characters' story arcs in some way.

                        There's plenty of excitement and joy to be found in Justice League. Some of the action scenes are truly mesmerizing to watch. The humour is gleeful and doesn't feel out of place or shoe-horned in. One of the biggest surprises for me was just how much I fell in love with Ezra Miller's version of The Flash, and I think it's safe to say he's the MVP of the movie.

                        The blistering pace of the film might make it difficult to absorb for some. But I can forgive the rapid pacing, because let's face it, this movie has a monumental task to accomplish in just two hours. It has to set up three new core characters that we need to care about and root for, while growing the team dynamic between the new members and the ones we already know. Oh, and it also has to introduce us to a brand new villain, his scheme, and set up a plan for our heroes to thwart him. Out of all these, Justice League is most successful in building the League itself. And even if all else fails, this is truly the heart of the movie. So the fact that it set up this brand new team in a believable way, is something to marvel (pardon the pun) at. The interactions between the team are without a doubt the best parts of the film.

                        However, Justice League is not without its faults. It's certainly far from a perfect movie, and as a personal fan of the artistic perfection that Zack Snyder paints each of his frames with, it was disheartening to see a film that didn't quite live up to the visual beauty that we have come to take for granted in Snyder's films. However, considering the personal tragedy and professional hurdles that the production team had to face, I can't really hold it against them. In a perfect world we would have seen the full and whole vision that Snyder had, and as fan of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I can't help but feel that a pure Snyder cut of this film would have been more satisfying for me personally. But it isn't a perfect world. Getting to see this league of heroes come together on the big screen, was a joy on its own, and I can more than live with that.

                       I've followed every bit of news (even the rumors) surrounding the production of the film leading up to its release. So it's safe to say, I went into this movie expecting to see certain things. I wasn't planning on being surprised. Boy, was I wrong. Somehow, and to their credit, Warner Brothers really managed to keep so much of this film under wraps. So even if you think you know how the story's going to go, don't be so sure. And, those post-credit scenes are fan-service at its very best.

But somehow, the movie in itself doesn't quite fulfill the promises of its predecessors. There are powerful and poignant moments in the previous films that could have served as brilliant callbacks in this one, but were left untouched. Instead, this film seems to shy away from its divisive past, and focuses solely on setting up a brighter future. For better or worse, Justice League under-delivers on previous promises, all the while painting a vibrant and exciting future that lies on the horizon for this universe. Let us 'hope', that it will deliver on these promises.</p>
